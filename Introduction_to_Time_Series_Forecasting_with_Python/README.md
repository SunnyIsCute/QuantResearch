# Introduction to Time Series Forecasting with Python

This folder contains my notes and Jupyter notebooks based on the book *Introduction to Time Series Forecasting with Python* by Jason Brownlee.

The goal is to reinforce concepts and provide hands-on implementations of classical and modern time series forecasting techniques using Python.
