# QuantResearch
QuantResearch is a collection of my notes and practice projects on quantitative research and financial data analysis. It explores a range of foundational topics in quantitative finance and serves as both a personal learning record and a reference for others interested in the field. The goal of this repository is to gain hands-on experience with the underlying methods and details.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Historical Data Download: retrieving and preprocessing market data from APIs
- Portfolio Optimization: mean-variance optimization and allocation strategies

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repository is intended to:
- Provide hands-on implementations of key quantitative methods
- Serve as structured notes for ongoing learning
- Act as a reference resource for applying statistical and machine learning tools in finance

## ðŸ”® Future Work
Planned additions include:
- Advanced forecasting models (ARIMA, GARCH, deep learning)
- Factor models & asset pricing
